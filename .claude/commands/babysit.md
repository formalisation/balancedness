# Babysit

Run one full cycle of the autonomous autoformalization lifecycle.

This command is for Claude Code acting as the implementation engineer. Codex/the
human reviewer owns mathematical direction and accepts or rejects changes. Do not
send alerts or consult external chat models. Commit and push are part of the
cycle (step 10); do not run other CI/deploy workflows.

**CRITICAL: Every cycle MUST make progress.** If there are 0 sorry's, focus on code quality and mathematical-strength issues from `CRITICISMS.md`. A "no-op" cycle is only acceptable if `CRITICISMS.md` has zero open issues.

**CRITICAL: Every step below MUST be executed.** Do not skip steps. Even if a step has "nothing to do", run the command and let it determine that.

## State tracking

Before starting, check if `state.md` exists in the project root. If it does, read it to find which step to resume from. If not, start from step 1.

Before each step, write the current step number and name to `state.md`. After completing all steps, delete `state.md`.

## Steps

1. `/critique` — Adversarial analysis of current state (refreshes `CRITICISMS.md`)
2. `/plan` — Assess current state and produce prioritized work plan
3. `/submit-aristotle` — Submit hard lemmas to Aristotle (if any ready)
4. `/prove` — Close sorry's directly (decompose into sub-lemmas as needed)
5. `/check-aristotle` — Fetch and integrate completed Aristotle proofs
6. `/simplify` — Fix code quality issues from `CRITICISMS.md`. Must fix at least one issue per cycle if any remain open.
7. `/strengthen` — Improve mathematical content: weaken hypotheses, strengthen conclusions, resolve epistemic issues from `CRITICISMS.md`. Must make meaningful progress each cycle.
8. `/log` — Record what changed in `PROGRESS.md`
9. `/cleanup` — Delete stale files and dead code
10. `/commit` — Commit and push all changes
